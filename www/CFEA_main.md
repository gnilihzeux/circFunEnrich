This panel will perform canonical functional enrichment analysis(CFEA) for  co-expressed genes of circRNAs.

The details is as follows:

1. To input expression matrix of circRNA & gene
2. To calculate the pearson correlation of circRNA & gene
3. To define co-expressed genes with cutoffs
4. To perform CFEA using fisher's exact test for co-expressed genes
5. To plot barplot & dotplot
