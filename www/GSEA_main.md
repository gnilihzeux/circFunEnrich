This section would like to predict functions of a certain circRNA through genes with pearson correlation in expression by performing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis(GSEA). 

The process is as follows:

1. To input circRNA & gene expression profiles
2. To calculate the pearson correlation between circRNA & genes
3. To plot correlation heatmap using the most positive and the most negative correlated 50 genes separately
4. To perform GSEA using correlation coefficient
5. To plot lollipop-plot using 10 pathways of the largest and 10 ones of the least enrichment score(ES) 
6. To plot gsea-plot of the specified pathway
